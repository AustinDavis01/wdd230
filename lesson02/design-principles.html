            <p>
                    the rule of thirds refers to a 3 by 3 grid to figurativly put on top of a image. 
                we use this grid to make imges imteresting to look at. website design uses Rule of 
                Thirds making components different sizes and therefore more interesting to look at.
                in the Screeshot above you can see that apple splits the website into 3 parts
                making it more apealing to the eye.

            <p>
                    White Space or other wise know as "negative space" doesnt seem like it would be
                an important part of a website but it is a crucial part to whre your eyes look
                and the apeal of the website. The screeshot of samsungs website shows different porducts 
                evenly spaced out with white space in between. Without the white space it would
                look cramped.

            <p>
                    Contrast is one of the most important parts of web design it is the 
                difference between if someone enjoys being in your website or not. Contrast
                is how unsimilar elements are on the page compared to each other. For instance
                the screen shot of lg's website shows great contrast because all colors work well together
                and the contrast between the back groound and the butto makes you look at the button.
